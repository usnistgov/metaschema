# Metaschema Metapath

A prototype / proof-of-concept path evaluation library.

Provides for processing Metapath syntax and operations dependent on processing such as path rewriting.

Modules here including `metapath-jsonize.xsl` and `docs-metapath.xsl` may be included or called into pipelines elsewhere in this library.

Provided XSpec tests along with inline code help to document the interfaces.
