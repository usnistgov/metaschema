# Metaschema comparison logic

The XProc 1.0 pipeline and supporting XSLTs provide the capability of comparing two metaschemas. The metaschemas to be compared can be hard-wired in the XProc or provided as a runtime option.

A metaschema is "composed" before comparison. The composition logic has not been updated to next-generation Metaschema yet (at time of writing).
The results are HTML decorated with markdown, so for pasting into a plain text environment. However, an HTML-to-plaintext filter could be added to produce better clean plain text.

HTML files in this directory are examples of the tool in application, as applied to OSCAL metaschemas.
