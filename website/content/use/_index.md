Currently, the Metaschema syntax uses an [XML-based format](https://github.com/usnistgov/metaschema/schema/). Alternate formats (e.g., JSON, YAML) are currently being considered.

An [ISO Schematron](http://schematron.com/) ruleset is also [provided](https://github.com/david-waltermire-nist/metaschema/blob/master/toolchains/oscal-m2/lib/metaschema-check.sch) to enforce some of the rules described below.
