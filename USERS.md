# Users Guide

Metaschema provides a common, format-agnostic modeling language supporting schema, code, and documentation generation all in one. XML, JSON, and YAML formats are supported through this format-agnostic approach.

Current modeling technologies (i.e. XML Schema, JSON Schema, Schematron) are:

- Uneven in their modeling expressiveness and validation capability;
- Unable to express a single model that applies to all supported formats;
- Bound to an individual formats (i.e., XML, JSON, YAML); and
- Time-consuming and labor-intensive when maintain multiple format-specific models.

This project supports users who are interested in modeling data in a format-agnostic way, and tool developers authoring tools to support such users.

More information about the Metaschema approach can be found on the [project's website](https://pages.nist.gov/metaschema/).
