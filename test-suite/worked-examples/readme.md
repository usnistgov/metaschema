# Worked Examples - Metaschema

Current status: **some updates needed**

Anthology example is working - shows 'plausible' use cases for a range of different metaschema modeling features.

'Everything' metaschema has not been updated and needs refreshing.

## TODO

test
  schema validations
    M4 and oscal-cli schemas
  round tripping
    unit test any repairs?

review ../schema-generation/

See work in `../schema-generation/json-value-key` and `group-as`
