# Grouping - `group-as`

Feature set for assigning names to groups, supported in different and various forms in both JSON (objects, arrays, combination) and XML (implicit and explicitly wrapped groups).

**Status** - untested, unknown -

These tests are known to have run in the past but current status is not confirmed.

TODO group-as-by-key is known to be non-functional unit test that first!
