# Datatypes

**Status** 

- updated 2022 Aug 29 (cleaned up outdated target files)

The metaschemas here all successfully build schemas, invoking various data types for purpose of exercising lexical constraint testing (for example, does a URI look sufficiently like a URI).

These tests are known to have run in the past but current status is not confirmed.

Work item: split this directory into several.
